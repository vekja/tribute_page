          The Russian Pavlovskaya chicken was nearly extinct in the early 1990s,
          with only a single pure-<br />bred, fertile rooster remaining. Though
          they remain ultra-rare, today they have been brought <br />back from
          the brink of extinction due to the dedication and <br />enthusiasm of
          lovers of this chicken breed.

            medium-sized and tinted, numbering less than 100 eggs per year. It
            is said that their meat is similar to that of wild game birds, but
            their bodies are not large enough to be worth it to process for
            meat.

            'You have chickens?' That's what nearly everyone asks next, after
            they find out about our family pets. They just need to make sure
            they heard me correctly. Perhaps it's because I don't come across to
            most as a rural-loving farm girl.
